# Resume Single Page Application

## Overview

Welcome to my Resume Single Page Application! This project is designed to showcase my skills and experience through an interactive and user-friendly interface. The application is built using the Vite framework, with React for the frontend and Tailwind for styling. The following libraries have been incorporated to enhance functionality:

### axios for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
### sweetalert2 for displaying stylish and customizable alerts.
### tailwind for efficient and responsive styling.
### normalize css for consistent rendering across different browsers.
### Design Inspiration

The design of this application is inspired by the meticulous planning in Figma. You can explore the detailed design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/YuAwEInBB8GqOO7wNosr5j/s12-design-darkmode?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design). The thoughtful consideration put into the design aims to provide a seamless and visually appealing experience to the users.

## Key Features

### Dark - Light Mode
The application offers both Dark and Light modes, and your preference is saved in the local storage. The initial mode is set to match your system preference, ensuring a personalized and comfortable viewing experience.

### Data Retrieval
The application fetches data from the Work in Tech API using Axios. This happens when components mount, ensuring that the content is always up-to-date and relevant.

### Language Preference
You can choose between Turkish and English as your language preference. The initial state is set based on your system preference, providing a multilingual experience.

### Global Context
To manage global state and streamline map functions across components, I've implemented the useContext feature. This ensures a cohesive and efficient handling of data throughout the application.
